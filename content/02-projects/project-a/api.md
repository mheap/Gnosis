The Late Philip J. Fry
======================

Meh. Oh yeah, good luck with that. There’s one way and only one way to
determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Bender, hurry!
This fuel’s expensive! Also, we’re dying!

Teenage Mutant Leela’s Hurdles
------------------------------

3.  Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I’m still

Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even
greater society above you! It must be wonderful. Well, let’s just dump
it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
