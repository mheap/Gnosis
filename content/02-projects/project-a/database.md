Knights of the Old Republic
===========================

What good is a reward if you ain’t around to use it? Besides, attacking
that battle station ain’t my idea of courage. It’s more like…suicide. I
don’t know what you’re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial
Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan– No! Alderaan is peaceful. We
have no weapons. You can’t possibly… All right. Well, take care of
yourself, Han. I guess that’s what you’re best at, ain’t it? Still,
she’s got a lot of spirit. I don’t know, what do you think?

The Republic
------------

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all
on board were killed. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing
through him. As you wish. She must have hidden the plans in the escape
pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally,
Commander. There’ll be no one to stop us this time!

-   The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

    all on board were killed.

### Jedi Academy

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Kid, I’ve flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other. I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff,
but I’ve never seen anything to make me believe there’s one all-powerful
Force controlling everything. There’s no mystical energy field that
controls my destiny. It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Hey,
Luke! May the Force be with you. Don’t be too proud of this
technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Leave that to me. Send
a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them. You are a part of the Rebel
Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

1.  Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster
    at your side, kid.
2.  I find your lack of faith disturbing.

##### The Clone Wars

Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution, and I’m not in it for you,
Princess. I expect to be well paid. I’m in it for the money. Don’t be
too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability
to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck.
