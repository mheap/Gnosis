Life on the Fast Lane
=====================

No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to
tell about it. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There’s a \*New\* Mexico?
How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I
learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember
when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?
Inflammable means flammable? What a country.

Selma’s Choice
--------------

Look out, Itchy! He’s Irish! Your guilty consciences may make you vote
Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to
lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Duffman
can’t breathe! OH NO! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty
Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs,
but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you’re
experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO
box…

-   A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy
    green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.
-   Please do not offer my god a peanut.
-   We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.
-   I’ll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These
    are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in
    business.

### Mr. Plow

Uh, no, they’re saying “Boo-urns, Boo-urns.” How is education supposed
to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it
pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home
winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? But, Aquaman, you cannot
marry a woman without gills. You’re from two different worlds… Oh, I’ve
wasted my life. Human contact: the final frontier. Oh, loneliness and
cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Whoa, slow down there, maestro.
There’s a \*New\* Mexico?

#### Rosebud

I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. He didn’t
give you gay, did he? Did he?! The Internet King? I wonder if he could
provide faster nudity…

1.  Old people don’t need companionship. They need to be isolated and
    studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might
    be extracted for our personal use.
2.  Save me, Jeebus.
3.  Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the
    drugs.
4.  How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every
    time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my
    brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I
    forgot how to drive?
5.  You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don’t work
    out in real life, uh, Christianity.

##### The Last Temptation of Homer

What good is money if it can’t inspire terror in your fellow man? A
lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green
glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Can’t you
people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can’t be policing
the entire city! Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove
anything that’s even remotely true!
