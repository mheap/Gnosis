Three Hundred Big Boys
======================

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Just once I’d like to eat dinner
with a celebrity who isn’t bound and gagged. Yeah. Give a little credit
to our public schools.

Hell Is Other Robots
--------------------

Belligerent and numerous. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Soothe
us with sweet lies.

-   No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that’s it.
-   Bender, quit destroying the universe!
-   I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc
    Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize
    money.
-   You wouldn’t. Ask anyway!

### A Clone of My Own

Calculon is gonna kill us and it’s all everybody else’s fault! Oh, I
think we should just stay friends. Check it out, y’all. Everyone who was
invited is here.

#### A Leela of Her Own

Man, I’m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty
Thor. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. You lived before
you met me?!

1.  I just told you! You’ve killed me!
2.  If rubbin’ frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don’t wanna be
    right.
3.  If rubbin’ frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don’t wanna be
    right.
4.  What are their names?

##### The Route of All Evil

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Oh yeah,
good luck with that. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Large bet
on myself in round one. If rubbin’ frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong,
hey I don’t wanna be right. Leela’s gonna kill me.
