How do you know she is a witch?
===============================

On second thoughts, let’s not go there. It is a silly place. Knights of
Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond
these woods. We shall say ‘Ni’ again to you, if you do not appease us.
We want a shrubbery!! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the
system!

Burn her! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! You don’t vote for kings. Oh, ow! And this
isn’t my nose. This is a false one. Now, look here, my good man.

-   Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!
-   A newt?
-   Who’s that then?
-   I dunno. Must be a king.

### Dennis the Peasant

Shut up! Who’s that then? Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut’s
tropical! I am your king. Camelot! And the hat. She’s a witch!

#### Sir Lancelot

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! And this isn’t my nose. This is a false one. We want a
shrubbery!!

1.  Oh, ow!
2.  Bring her forward!

##### The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

Well, I got better. You don’t frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil
your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called
Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
A newt? Did you dress her up like this? Well, Mercia’s a temperate zone!
A newt?
