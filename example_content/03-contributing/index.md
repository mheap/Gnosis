Mother’s Day
============

Leela, Bender, we’re going grave robbing. Does anybody else feel jealous
and aroused and worried? Meh. Your best is an idiot! Well, let’s just
dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.

A Clockwork Origin
------------------

Is that a cooking show? Fatal. Check it out, y’all. Everyone who was
invited is here. I’m sure those windmills will keep them cool. Meh.
Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.

-   That’s not soon enough!
-   Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an
    even greater society above you!
-   Calculon is gonna kill us and it’s all everybody else’s fault!
-   Bender, quit destroying the universe!
-   That’s right, baby. I ain’t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so
    much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

### The Prisoner of Benda

I’ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear
underpants. What am I, the pope? OK, if everyone’s finished being
stupid. You wouldn’t. Ask anyway! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some
candy. Of all the friends I’ve had… you’re the first.

#### Put Your Head on my Shoulder

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Bender, hurry! This fuel’s
expensive! Also, we’re dying! I’m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt
you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Leela’s gonna kill
me.

1.  What are their names?
2.  Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken
    away!
3.  Ah, the ‘Breakfast Club’ soundtrack! I can’t wait til I’m old enough
    to feel ways about stuff!
4.  But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
5.  Fatal.

##### Brannigan, Begin Again

I had more, but you go ahead. Yes, if you make it look like an
electrical fire. When you do things right, people won’t be sure you’ve
done anything at all. It must be wonderful. Soothe us with sweet lies.
You lived before you met me?!
