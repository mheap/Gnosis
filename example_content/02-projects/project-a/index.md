Let’s Give the Boy a Hand
=========================

Only you could make those words cute. I’m doing mental jumping jacks.
I’m thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? Pretend. You pretend the
feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows?
Maybe one day they will be. You’re a killer. I catch killers.

I am not a killer. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I’m Dexter, and I’m not sure
what I am. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a
mask … not just me. Makes me a … scientist. You’re a killer. I catch
killers.

-   You’re a killer. I catch killers.
-   Watching ice melt. This is fun.
-   Under normal circumstances, I’d take that as a compliment.
-   You look…perfect.
-   I’m not the monster he wants me to be. So I’m neither man nor beast.
    I’m something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I’m Dexter.
    Boo.

### Lost Boys

Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I like seafood.
Under normal circumstances, I’d take that as a compliment. I’m not the

new entirely. With my own set of rules. I’m Dexter. Boo. I think he’s
got a crush on you, Dex!

#### Father Knows Best

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the
people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I have a dark
side, too. You look…perfect. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are
there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one
day they will be. I’m doing mental jumping jacks.

1.  I’m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.
2.  Tonight’s the night. And it’s going to happen again and again. It
    has to happen.

##### It’s Alive!

I’m not the monster he wants me to be. So I’m neither man nor beast. I’m
something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I’m Dexter. Boo.
Finding a needle in a haystack isn’t hard when every straw is
computerized. Hello, Dexter Morgan. You all right, Dexter?
